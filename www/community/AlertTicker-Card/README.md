## 🔊 Text-to-Speech Announcements *(new in 1.2.2)*

Make Home Assistant read your alerts aloud the moment they trigger — on any speaker, Alexa Echo device, or Google Home.

```yaml
# Standard HA TTS (media_player + TTS engine)
alerts:
  - entity: binary_sensor.smoke_detector
    state: "on"
    message: "Smoke detected!"
    theme: fire
    tts: true                            # enable TTS for this alert
    tts_entity: media_player.living_room # speaker to use
    # tts_engine: tts.google_en_com      # auto-detected if omitted
```

```yaml
# Alexa Echo (via notify service)
alerts:
  - entity: binary_sensor.front_door
    state: "on"
    message: "Front door open"
    tts: true
    tts_notify_service: alexa_media_echo_dot_kitchen
    tts_message: "Attention — the front door is open"   # optional custom sentence
```

### How it works

- Enable `tts: true` on any individual alert.
- If no `tts_message` is set, the card **auto-generates a natural sentence** from a built-in dictionary in 10 languages, based on the alert's theme category. For example, a `critical` theme in Italian produces *"Allarme critico: Sensore fumo cucina"*.
- The spoken language is read from `hass.language` and falls back to English automatically.
- Set a global **master toggle** (`tts_enabled: false`) in the General tab to disable all TTS at once without losing per-alert settings.

### TTS service options

| Method | When to use | Config |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| **Standard TTS** | HA media players, Sonos, Chromecast | `tts_entity` (speaker) + optional `tts_engine` |
| **notify service** | Alexa, Google Home via notify, mobile push | `tts_notify_service` (any `notify.*` service) |

Per-alert fields override global card-level defaults, so you can have one speaker for most alerts and a different one for critical alerts.

### Card-level TTS options

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|--------|------|---------|-------------|
| `tts_enabled` | `boolean` | `true` | Master toggle — set `false` to silence all TTS globally |
| `tts_entity` | `string` | — | Default `media_player.*` speaker entity |
| `tts_engine` | `string` | *(auto)* | TTS engine entity (auto-detected from first `tts.*` state) |
| `tts_notify_service` | `string` | — | Default notify service for Alexa / push |
| `tts_language` | `string` | — | Language code passed to `tts.speak` (e.g. `it-IT`) |

### Per-alert TTS options

| Option | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `tts` | `boolean` | Enable TTS for this alert |
| `tts_entity` | `string` | Override the global speaker for this alert |
| `tts_engine` | `string` | Override the global TTS engine |
| `tts_notify_service` | `string` | Override the global notify service |
| `tts_message` | `string` | Custom spoken text (supports `{name}`, `{state}`, Jinja2) |

---

## 📱 Mobile Push Notifications *(new in 1.3)*

Send a push notification to any Home Assistant `notify.*` service the moment an alert fires — works with the HA Companion App, Telegram, Pushover, and any other notify integration.

```yaml
alerts:
  - entity: binary_sensor.front_door
    state: "on"
    theme: door
    message: "Front door open"
    push_notify: true
    push_notify_service: mobile_app_my_phone         # required
    push_notify_title: "🚪 Door Alert"               # optional, Jinja2
    push_notify_message: "Door opened — {state}"     # optional, Jinja2
```

### How it works

- Enable `push_notify: true` on any individual alert.
- If no `push_notify_title` is set, the card uses the alert's **badge label** (or `name` if set).
- If no `push_notify_message` is set, the card uses the alert's **display message** (same text shown in the ticker).
- Both fields support `{state}`, `{name}`, `{entity}`, `{device}` placeholders and full Jinja2 templates.
- Set a global **master toggle** (`push_notify_enabled: false`) in the General tab → 📱 Push Notifications to disable all push notifications at once without touching individual alerts.

### Per-alert push notification options

| Option | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `push_notify` | `boolean` | Enable push notification for this alert |
| `push_notify_service` | `string` | `notify.*` service name (e.g. `mobile_app_my_phone`, `notify.telegram`) |
| `push_notify_title` | `string` | Notification title — Jinja2, defaults to badge label |
| `push_notify_message` | `string` | Notification message — Jinja2, defaults to alert message |

## 🎵 Music Player Mode *(new in 1.2.6)*

Turn any `media_player.*` entity into a full graphical player card. When `show_player_controls: true` is set and the entity is a media player, the `music` theme renders a cinematic player UI instead of the default floating notes.

```yaml
alerts:
  - entity: media_player.spotify_davide
    theme: music
    show_player_controls: true
    music_player_color: "#e040fb"   # optional accent color
```

### What the player shows

| Element | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Album art background** | Blurred, saturated backdrop pulled from `entity_picture` |
| **Spinning vinyl** | Circular album art thumbnail on the right — spins while playing, stops on pause |
| **Equalizer bars** | 3 animated bars pulse next to "NOW PLAYING" when playing; ◼ pause dot when paused |
| **Track info** | `media_title` as title, `media_artist` below |
| **Playback controls** | ⏮ previous · ⏸/▶ play-pause · ⏭ next |
| **Mute toggle** | 🔇/🔊 — highlights in accent color when muted |
| **Volume slider** | Live range slider — gradient fills to current level, updates in real time while dragging |
| **Accent line** | Animated gradient line at the bottom, pulses in the accent color |

### Accent color

All colors in the player UI (buttons, glow, equalizer, vinyl ring, accent line) are driven by a single **`--mu-accent` CSS custom property**, set from `music_player_color`. Change it from the editor's color picker to instantly retheme the entire player:

```yaml
music_player_color: "#00e5ff"   # cyan
music_player_color: "#69f0ae"   # green
music_player_color: "#ff4081"   # pink
```

### Auto-setup in the editor

Selecting a `media_player.*` entity in the visual editor automatically:
- Sets theme to `music`
- Enables `show_player_controls`
- Sets `state: playing` and `operator: =`

Switching back to a non-media-player entity reverts to `emergency`.

### Player-mode options

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|--------|------|---------|-------------|
| `show_player_controls` | `boolean` | `false` | Enable the graphical player UI (requires `media_player.*` entity) |
| `music_player_color` | `string` | `#e040fb` | Accent color for all player UI elements — any CSS color |
| `music_show_art` | `boolean` | `true` | Show album artwork (background blur + thumbnail) |
| `music_show_title` | `boolean` | `true` | Show track title (with marquee scroll for long titles) |
| `music_show_artist` | `boolean` | `true` | Show artist name |
| `music_show_controls` | `boolean` | `true` | Show previous / play-pause / next / mute buttons and volume slider |
| `music_show_power` | `boolean` | `false` | Add a power icon (bottom-right corner) — calls `media_player.turn_off` |
| `music_show_player_picker` | `boolean` | `false` | Add a cast icon (bottom-right corner) — opens a dropdown to switch the active player for this session |
| `music_compact_layout` | `boolean` | `false` | Compact layout: track title and artist move to the top-right column, controls stay left — ideal for small/narrow displays |

## 📷 Camera in Overlay Banner & Card Background *(snapshot: 1.2.2 · live stream + card bg: 1.3.1)*

Attach a **camera image** to an alert — either as a snapshot in the overlay banner, a live stream in the banner, or a background layer behind the alert card slide.

```yaml
alerts:
  - entity: binary_sensor.front_door_motion
    state: "on"
    message: "Motion at front door"
    theme: intruder
    camera_entity: camera.front_door     # required for all camera features
    overlay_mode: true                   # show overlay banner at card level
    camera_live: true                    # live stream in banner (default: false = snapshot)
    camera_in_card: true                 # camera background in the card slide
```

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `camera_entity` | Camera entity whose image is used |
| `camera_live` | `true` = live HLS/WebRTC stream in the overlay banner; `false` (default) = static snapshot |
| `camera_in_card` | `true` = camera image shown as a background layer behind the alert card slide on every rotation |

- The snapshot/stream appears **below the alert header row** inside the overlay toast. Its height scales proportionally with `overlay_scale`.
- `camera_in_card` uses the entity's `entity_picture` attribute as a CSS background image, visible across the full card behind a semi-transparent overlay. Works with all 50 themes.
- If a snapshot fails to load, the image is silently removed and the banner stays intact.
- `camera_live` requires a camera entity with HLS or WebRTC stream support. Falls back to static snapshot when the `<ha-camera-stream>` component is not yet loaded.

## How It Works

### Alert lifecycle

1. Configure one or more **alerts**, each linked to an entity + condition
2. When an entity matches the condition (and any extra `conditions` rules), the alert becomes **active**
3. Active alerts are **sorted by priority** (1=most critical)
4. The card **displays** the current alert and **auto-cycles** through multiple active alerts
5. Use ◀ / ▶ buttons (or swipe) to jump between alerts manually
6. **Tap** or **hold** the card to execute configured actions
7. **Snooze** any alert with 💤 — one tap for fixed duration, or choose from the menu
8. **📋** opens the alert history with timestamps
9. When no alerts are active and `show_when_clear: true`, the card shows the **all-clear state** (message, clock, or weather)

### Transition animations

When multiple alerts are active, the card cycles using the selected animation:

| Animation | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `fold` *(default)* | 3D page-turn along the X axis |
| `slide` | Horizontal push left/right |
| `fade` | Cross-dissolve opacity fade |
| `flip` | RotateY card flip |
| `zoom` | Scale punch in/out |
| `glitch` | Clip-path jitter digital noise |
| `bounce` | Elastic spring from below |
| `swing` | RotateZ pendulum |
| `blur` | Gaussian dissolve |
| `split` | Vertical split (top up, bottom down) |
| `roll` | RotateY + translateX combined roll |
| `curtain` | Opens from center (theater curtain) |

### Manual alert navigation

When 2 or more alerts are active, **◀** and **▶** buttons appear on the left/right edges on hover (first touch on mobile). Clicking jumps to the previous/next alert and resets the auto-cycle timer. On mobile, **left/right swipe** also navigates (if `swipe_to_snooze` is enabled, left-swipe keeps its snooze behaviour and only right-swipe navigates).

### Secondary entity value

Display a live entity value as a second line below the alert message:

```yaml
- entity: sensor.open_zones
  operator: "!="
  state: "0"
  message: "Zones open"
  secondary_entity: sensor.open_zones_list
  secondary_attribute: zone_names   # optional — read an attribute instead of state
```

### tap_action / hold_action / double_tap_action

Standard Lovelace interactions — tap, hold (500 ms), or double-tap the whole card to trigger any action:

```yaml
- entity: binary_sensor.front_door
  state: "on"
  message: "Front door open"
  tap_action:
    action: more-info
    entity_id: binary_sensor.front_door
  hold_action:
    action: navigate
    navigation_path: /lovelace/security
  double_tap_action:
    action: call-service
    service: lock.lock
    target:
      entity_id: lock.front_door
```

> When `double_tap_action` is set, a single tap waits 300 ms to distinguish the two gestures.

Supported action types: `call-service`, `navigate`, `more-info`, `url`, `none`.

### on_change — trigger on any state change

Fire an alert whenever an entity changes state, regardless of the `operator`/`state` condition. The alert stays visible until the next state change, or auto-dismisses after `auto_dismiss_after` seconds:

```yaml
- entity: media_player.living_room
  on_change: true
  auto_dismiss_after: 15
  message: "Now playing: {state}"
  theme: notification
```

### time_range — restrict to a time window

Show an alert only within a specific time window. Supports midnight crossing:

```yaml
- entity: binary_sensor.front_door
  state: "on"
  message: "Door open at night!"
  time_range:
    from: "22:00"
    to: "07:00"
  theme: intruder
```

The card re-evaluates at each minute boundary so alerts appear and disappear on time without any entity state change. Leave both fields empty for always-active.

### visible_to — per-alert user filter

Restrict an alert to specific Home Assistant users without separate cards or conditional wrappers:

```yaml
- entity: sensor.server_load
  state: "high"
  message: "Server load critical"
  visible_to: admin          # admin | non_admin | "John" | ["John", "Maria"]
```

| Value | Effect |
|-------|--------|
| `admin` | Admins only |
| `non_admin` | Non-admin users only |
| `"Display Name"` | Single user by display name |
| `["Name1", "Name2"]` | Multiple users by display name |
| *(omit)* | Shown to everyone |

### device_class — auto-discover by device class

Instead of listing individual entities or writing a text filter, specify a HA device class. The card auto-discovers every entity with that class and creates one alert per match:

```yaml
- device_class: smoke
  state: "on"
  message: "Smoke detected: {name}"
  theme: fire
  priority: 1

- device_class: battery
  attribute: battery_level
  operator: "<="
  state: "15"
  message: "Low battery: {name} ({state}%)"
  theme: battery
  entity_filter_exclude:
    - sensor.battery_test_device
```

Supports the same `include`/`exclude` panel as `entity_filter` and all the same message placeholders (`{name}`, `{state}`, `{entity}`, `{device}`).

### Jinja2 in the `state` trigger field

The trigger threshold itself can be a Jinja2 template — useful when the threshold is stored in a helper entity:

```yaml
- entity: sensor.outdoor_temperature
  operator: ">"
  state: "{{ states('input_number.temp_alert_threshold') }}"
  message: "Temperature too high: {state}°"
```

Any HA template that evaluates to a string or number works here.

### All-clear widget (clock / weather / forecast)

When `show_when_clear: true` is set and no alerts are active, the card can show an animated clock, live weather display, or 7-day forecast instead of a plain text message:

```yaml
show_when_clear: true
clear_display_mode: weather_forecast   # see modes below
clear_weather_entity: weather.home
```

| Mode | Display |
|------|---------|
| `message` | Standard all-clear text message (default) |
| `clock` | Animated digital clock with date, deep navy background and blue glow |
| `weather` | Animated weather background with condition, temperature, wind speed, humidity |
| `weather_clock` | Weather background + clock badge in top-right corner |
| `forecast` | **NEW** — full 7-day forecast grid: emoji, high/low temp, precipitation bars, today highlighted |
| `weather_forecast` | **NEW** — alternates every 5 s between current weather + clock and 7-day forecast |

Weather modes show full animated particle backgrounds (sun rays, stars/moon/aurora, floating clouds, fog, wind streaks, rain, snow, hail, lightning, exceptional). All weather info and the clock are rendered as frosted-glass corner badges so the animated sky stays fully visible.

#### 🗓️ 7-day forecast widget

The `forecast` and `weather_forecast` modes display a full-width daily forecast grid sourced from HA's `weather/subscribe_forecast` WebSocket API (HA 2023.9+):

- **Weather emoji** and condition label for each day
- **High / low temperatures** color-coded: blue (cold) → amber (warm) → red (hot)
- **Precipitation probability bar** visible when ≥20%
- **Today's column** elevated with frosted glass, floating emoji animation, and accent glow
- Day labels auto-localized via `Intl.DateTimeFormat` in all 11 supported languages

When used with `show_widget_in_cycle: true`, the card ensures **both** the weather panel and forecast panel have been shown before advancing to the next alert.

#### Clock styles (`clear_display_mode: clock`)

| Style | Visual |
|-------|--------|
| *(default)* | Deep navy background, blue glow digits |
| `aurora` | Animated northern-lights gradient background, green glow |
| `gold` | Warm golden hue, thin weight digits |
| `matrix` | Black background, monospace green digits with scanline glow |

#### Weather badge styles (all weather modes)

| Style | Layout |
|-------|--------|
| *(default)* | Animated sky, frosted corner badges |
| `stage` | Large centered clock on top; weather compacted into a single horizontal frosted pill below |
| `split` | Card divided into two equal full-height panels — left: weather icon + temperature, right: clock |
| `cinematic` | Animated weather background fills the entire card; all info condensed into a transparent caption bar pinned to the bottom |

> The `split` style works with all weather modes including `weather_forecast` — the first panel shows weather + clock side by side, then alternates with the 7-day forecast.

Configure these in the editor (All Clear tab). Use `clear_clock_show_date` to toggle the date display, and `clear_clock_date_position` (`above` / `below`) to choose its position relative to the time.

### Weather/time as a slide in the alert cycle

Insert the configured clear widget (clock / weather / weather+clock) as an extra slide in the alert rotation — displayed between alerts like any other:

```yaml
show_widget_in_cycle: true
clear_display_mode: weather_clock
clear_weather_entity: weather.home
```

The widget uses the same `cycle_animation` and `cycle_interval` as alerts. Enable this in the editor (Cycling & Animation section), visible only when `clear_display_mode` is already configured.

### Overlay / toast notification

Enable a global floating banner that fires when a new alert triggers — **visible from any dashboard view**, not just the one where the card lives:

```yaml
overlay_mode: true
overlay_position: top     # top | center | bottom
overlay_duration: 8       # seconds before auto-dismiss (0 = manual close only)
overlay_scale: 1.5        # 1 | 1.5 | 2 | 3 — enlarge for wall displays
```

How it works:
- When the card's view is **currently visible**, the banner is suppressed (no redundant notification — the card itself already shows the alert).
- When you navigate away to another view (or the card is off-screen), an independent watcher reads entity states from the always-present `<home-assistant>` element every 2 seconds and fires the banner automatically.
- A 10-second deduplication window prevents the same alert from firing twice.
- The banner is styled according to the alert category (Critical / Warning / Info / OK / Style / Timer) and dismisses automatically after `overlay_duration` seconds, or manually via the × button.

#### Overlay scale

Use `overlay_scale` to enlarge the entire banner for wall-mounted tablets or TVs:

| Value | Effect |
|-------|--------|
| `1` | Default size |
| `1.5` | 50% larger — font, icon, padding, border-radius all scale |
| `2` | Double size — ideal for wall tablets |
| `3` | Triple size — for TV or kiosk displays |

The max-width grows with the scale while staying within the viewport. Camera snapshot images (if set) also scale proportionally.

Position options:
| Value | Behavior |
|-------|----------|
| `top` | Slides in from the top of the screen |
| `center` | Pops in at the center of the screen (scale animation) |
| `bottom` | Slides in from the bottom of the screen |

### Snooze

Tap 💤 on any active alert to snooze it. Two modes (configurable in General tab):

- **Menu** *(default)* — choose 1h / 4h / 8h / 24h from a menu on the card
- **Fixed duration** — configure 30min / 1h / 4h / 8h / 24h for immediate one-tap snooze

Snoozed alerts persist in `localStorage` and the card restores them automatically when the duration expires. A small amber 💤 pill appears when some alerts are snoozed while others remain active — tap it to resume all.

### snooze_action

Execute a Lovelace action when the 💤 button is tapped, in addition to snoozing. Useful for resetting sensors:

```yaml
- entity: binary_sensor.mailbox
  state: "on"
  message: "Mail arrived"
  snooze_action:
    action: call-service
    service: input_boolean.turn_off
    target:
      entity_id: input_boolean.mailbox_flag
```

### Alert history

Tap 📋 to flip the card and view a timestamped log of every alert that became active. Includes a Clear button. History is stored in `localStorage` (configurable max: 25 / 50 / 100 / 200 events).

### entity_filter

Instead of specifying a single entity, write a text filter. The card finds all entities whose ID or friendly name contains the filter text and creates one alert per match:

```yaml
- entity_filter: "battery"
  attribute: battery_level
  operator: "<="
  state: "20"
  message: "Low battery: {name} ({state}%)"
  theme: battery
  entity_filter_exclude:
    - sensor.battery_test_device
```

**Message placeholders:**

| Placeholder | Replaced with |
|---|---|
| `{name}` | Entity friendly name |
| `{entity}` | Entity ID |
| `{state}` | Current state value (translated) |
| `{device}` | HA device name from the device registry |
| `{timer}` | Live countdown for `timer.*` entities (`mm:ss` / `h:mm:ss`) |

The matched entity's friendly name is also automatically shown below the message so you always know which device triggered the alert.

### HA template syntax in messages

The `message` field (and `secondary_text`) supports **full Jinja2 template syntax** — rendered server-side by Home Assistant via the WebSocket API, with live updates whenever entities change.

```yaml
# Simple sensor value
- entity: sensor.co2_ppm
  operator: ">"
  state: "1000"
  message: "CO₂: {{ states('sensor.co2_ppm') }} ppm"

# Attribute value
- entity: climate.hvac
  state: heating
  message: "Heating — room: {{ state_attr('climate.hvac', 'current_temperature') }}°"

# Conditional logic
- entity: sensor.battery_phone
  operator: "<"
  state: "20"
  message: >
    {% if states('sensor.battery_phone') | int < 10 %}
      Critical: {{ states('sensor.battery_phone') }}%
    {% else %}
      Low battery: {{ states('sensor.battery_phone') }}%
    {% endif %}

# Time / date
- entity: binary_sensor.night_mode
  state: "on"
  message: "Night mode active since {{ now().strftime('%H:%M') }}"

# Math / unit conversion
- entity: sensor.power_consumption
  operator: ">"
  state: "2000"
  message: "High consumption: {{ (states('sensor.power_consumption') | float / 1000) | round(2) }} kW"
```

Any template that works in HA automations and template sensors works here too.

**Editor preview:** type a filter text and a live counter shows how many entities match. Click the counter to expand a full list with names, entity IDs and current states. Click any entity to exclude it (✗) or re-include it (✓).

### Timer themes

Select a `timer.*` entity and use one of the 4 dedicated timer themes. The card reads `finishes_at` from the timer attributes and updates the display every second:

```yaml
- entity: timer.ad_blocker_paused
  state: active
  message: "Ad blocking disabled for {timer}"
  theme: countdown
```

Use `{timer}` in the message to display the live countdown (`mm:ss` or `h:mm:ss`).

When a timer entity is selected in the editor, `state` is automatically set to `active` and the theme switches to `countdown`.

### Numeric / comparison conditions

```yaml
- entity: sensor.co2_ppm
  operator: ">"
  state: "1000"
  message: "CO₂ level critical!"
```

Supported operators: `=` (default), `!=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`, `contains`, `not_contains`.

### Attribute-based triggers

```yaml
- entity: sensor.phone
  attribute: battery_level
  operator: "<"
  state: "20"
  message: "Phone battery critical"
  theme: battery
```

### AND / OR multi-entity conditions

```yaml
- entity: binary_sensor.front_door
  state: "on"
  conditions_logic: "and"
  conditions:
    - entity: input_boolean.night_mode
      operator: "="
      state: "on"
  message: "Door open at night"
  theme: intruder
```

- `and` — all conditions must match (default)
- `or` — at least one condition must match

### HA icons (mdi:)

Enable the `use_ha_icon` toggle per alert to use a native HA icon instead of an emoji. When enabled, the card first reads the entity's icon from the HA entity registry — so you get the correct icon automatically without setting it manually. You can also pick any `mdi:` or `hass:` icon from the native HA icon picker in the editor. Combine with `icon_color` to tint the icon with any CSS color.

Any icon namespace is accepted — not just `mdi:` and `hass:`. Icons from `hue:`, `phu:`, `cil:`, and any other custom set registered via `extra_module_url` work automatically.

### Entity picture / custom image as icon *(new in 1.3.9.8)*

Two new options let you use an image instead of an emoji or MDI icon.

**`use_entity_picture`** — pulls the image HA shows for the entity (`entity_picture` attribute). Works with any entity that exposes a picture: bin/waste sensors, person trackers, camera thumbnails, weather entities, etc.

```yaml
alerts:
  - entity: sensor.bin_collection
    state: "on"
    message: 🗑️ Bin day!
    use_entity_picture: true
    icon_size: 2rem   # optional, default 2rem
```

**`icon_image`** — point directly to any image by path or URL, without needing an entity with `entity_picture`. Takes priority over `use_entity_picture` if both are set.

```yaml
alerts:
  - entity: binary_sensor.front_door
    state: "on"
    message: Porta aperta
    icon_image: /local/immagini/porta.png
    icon_size: 3rem
```

Both options render a small rounded square image. `icon_size` accepts any CSS length (`2rem`, `48px`, etc.) and its field appears automatically in the visual editor when either option is active.

### Message placeholders

`{state}`, `{name}`, `{entity}`, and `{device}` work in the `message` field of **any** alert that has an entity set — not just `entity_filter` alerts:

```yaml
- entity: sensor.meter_abe4
  operator: "<="
  state: "20"
  message: "Battery low: {state}%"
  secondary_text: "Device: {device}"
```

### secondary_text

A static second line displayed below the message. Supports placeholders. Does not require a secondary entity:

```yaml
secondary_text: "Zone: {name} — Current: {state}"
```

### Badge customization

Hide the category badge or replace its text:

```yaml
show_badge: false        # hide completely
badge_label: "URGENT"   # or use a custom label
```

### Sound notifications

Play an audio tone when an alert becomes active. Uses the Web Audio API — no files required for the default tones:

```yaml
- entity: binary_sensor.smoke_detector
  state: "on"
  message: "Smoke detected!"
  sound: true
  sound_url: "https://example.com/alarm.mp3"  # optional custom sound
```

Default tones by category: Critical = double high beep · Warning = medium beep · Info = soft beep · OK = rising chime.

> **Note:** requires browser autoplay permission. Works out of the box on wall-mounted tablets with HA Companion.

### Large buttons

Always-visible pill-shaped 💤 and 📋 buttons — useful for wall-mounted tablets where hover is not available:

```yaml
large_buttons: true
```

### Swipe to snooze

Enable a left-swipe gesture to snooze the current alert on touch devices. Works independently of `tap_action` and `hold_action` — no conflict:

```yaml
swipe_to_snooze: true
```

Swipe at least 60 px horizontally to trigger. Uses the configured `snooze_duration` (or 1 h if none is set).

### Invisible touch zone (mobile)

A 22%-wide invisible zone on the right side of the card reveals the action buttons (snooze / history / nav arrows) on the first tap. The buttons auto-hide after 4 seconds. Never interferes with `tap_action`, `hold_action`, or `double_tap_action`.

### Vertical layout

Stack the icon on top and the message below, centered — useful for narrow columns or square card grids:

```yaml
vertical: true
```

Works with all 50 themes. The **Ticker** theme keeps its horizontal scrolling. Can be combined with `ha_theme: true` and `large_buttons: true`.

### HA theme adaptation

Adapt the card's color palette to the active Home Assistant global theme:

```yaml
ha_theme: true
```

When enabled:
- Card background → `--card-background-color`
- Text → `--primary-text-color` / `--secondary-text-color`
- Critical badges/borders → `--error-color`
- Warning badges/borders → `--warning-color`
- Info badges/borders → `--info-color`
- OK badges/borders → `--success-color`

All 50 visual themes retain their animations and layouts — only the color palette adapts. Compatible with Mushroom, Material, iOS, and any custom HA theme.

### Card border

Enable a persistent visible border around the card using the standard HA border style:

```yaml
card_border: true
```

Default: `false` (off). Uses `--ha-card-border-width` and `--ha-card-border-color` from the active HA theme. When `card_border` is on and the card is otherwise hidden (no alerts, `show_when_clear` off), a subtle dashed placeholder with a 🔔 icon is shown so the card remains discoverable and editable.

### Test mode

Force all configured alerts to display as active — useful for previewing the card appearance without waiting for real conditions:

```yaml
test_mode: true
```

> Remember to remove `test_mode` before going live. A yellow banner is shown on the card as a reminder.

In the visual editor, open the **Alerts tab** → enable **Test mode** at the bottom → expand any alert to instantly preview it on the card.

## Languages

The card automatically detects the language from your Home Assistant settings.

| Language | Code | Fallback |
|----------|------|---------|
| Italian | `it` | — |
| English | `en` | ✅ default |
| French | `fr` | — |
| German | `de` | — |
| Dutch | `nl` | — |
| Vietnamese | `vi` | — |
| Russian | `ru` | — |
| Danish | `da` | — |
| Czech | `cs` | — |
| Portuguese | `pt` | — |
| Spanish | `es` | — |
| Turkish | `tr` | — |

TTS fallback messages (auto-generated when no `tts_message` is set) are available in all 12 languages and adapt automatically to the alert's theme category (critical / warning / info / ok / timer).

## Troubleshooting

**Card not appearing after installation**
- Add `alert-ticker-card.js` as a JavaScript module in Settings → Dashboards → Resources
- Hard-reload the browser (Ctrl+Shift+R / Cmd+Shift+R)

**Features not working after update (secondary text, templates, new options)**
- HA and browsers cache custom card files aggressively. After updating, always do a **hard-reload** (`Ctrl+Shift+R` / `Cmd+Shift+R`) or go to **Settings → System → Restart → Clear cache and restart**. You can verify the running version by searching for `CARD_VERSION` in the JS file via browser DevTools.

**Entity picker not showing in editor**
- Known HA lazy-loading issue. The card handles it automatically. If it still doesn't appear, close and reopen the editor.

**Card disappears when alerts resolve**
- Set `show_when_clear: true` to keep the card visible.

**Trigger state not matching**
- State values are case-sensitive exact strings. Use the live **Current state** hint in the editor or check Developer Tools → States.

**Timer not updating**
- Ensure the timer entity state is `active`. The card reads `finishes_at` from the timer attributes. If `finishes_at` is missing, the countdown shows `--:--`.

**entity_filter matching too many entities**
- Use a more specific filter text, or click individual entities in the editor preview list to exclude them.

**Weather widget shows placeholder but entity is configured**
- Make sure `clear_display_mode` is set to `weather` or `weather_clock` AND `clear_weather_entity` points to a valid `weather.*` entity.

**TTS not playing**
- Check that `tts_enabled` is not `false`. For standard TTS, ensure `tts_entity` is a valid `media_player.*`. For Alexa, set `tts_notify_service` to the correct `alexa_media_*` service name (visible in Developer Tools → Services). The TTS engine is auto-detected from the first `tts.*` state — if none is found, set `tts_engine` explicitly.
- TTS and push notifications are fired directly from the browser tab and only work while the dashboard is open. The card does **not** create any server-side automations. For 24/7 delivery (when the browser is closed), create a native HA automation that calls the same `notify.*` or `tts.speak` service.

**Push notifications not arriving**
- Verify `push_notify_enabled` is not `false`. Check that `push_notify_service` matches the service name exactly (e.g. `mobile_app_my_phone` — without the `notify.` prefix). The card sends push via the HA frontend API while the dashboard is open. For 24/7 delivery, create a native HA automation that calls the same `notify.*` service.

**Camera image not appearing in overlay**
- Verify the `camera_entity` entity exists and has an `entity_picture` attribute in Developer Tools → States. The image is loaded directly from the HA proxied URL — no extra authentication needed on the local network.
